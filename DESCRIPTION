Description: IRT-M is a semi-supervised approach based on Bayesian Item Response Theory
    that produces theoretically identified underlying dimensions from input data
    and a constraints matrix. The methodology is fully described in 'Morucci et al. (2024),
    "Measurement That Matches Theory: Theory-Driven Identification in Item Response Theory Models"'.
