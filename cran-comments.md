## Particularities

The note on this package is asking whether we intend to specify the C++11 dependency.
This package implements a constrained Bayesian Item Response Theory (IRT) model.
We use C++ for our sampler for efficiency. 
C++11 is a widespread backbone of C++, so we've kept that specific version.
